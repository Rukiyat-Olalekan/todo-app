# To-Do App - Advanced
# Overview
* The Advanced To-Do App enables users to perform CRUD operations (add, read, edit, and delete to-dos). 
* Authentication is implemented to allow only authenticated users to edit their to-dos. Upon signing up, a user account is created, signifying authentication. 
* Advanced React features such as optimized post and get requests (using loaders and actions) enhance the app's performance.

# Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. React JS
5. React Router
6. Axios

# Installation
* Create the React app: npx create-react-app todo-app
* Start the development server: npm start
* Install React Router: npm install react-router-dom
* Install Axios: npm install axios

# Usage
* Access the app through your preferred browser.
* Perform basic to-do operations: add, read, and delete.
* Navigate to the sign-up page or log in if you already have an account to edit your to-dos.

* This app leverages the power of React and additional libraries for an enhanced user experience. The use of React Router facilitates navigation, while Axios handles efficient data fetching and sending.
